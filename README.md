# Introduction
I have worked on a dataset specifically focusing on data analyst roles and their related fields. My analysis involved identifying top-paying jobs and in-demand skills using SQL queries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and various functions like LEFT and INNER joins, as well as GROUP BY, among others.

- **SQL** : Backbone of the analysis
